# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

This project analyzes customer data from a telecom company to predict customer churn. Customer churn refers to the rate at which customers leave a business over a given period. Predicting churn helps businesses take proactive measures to retain customers, enhance satisfaction, and improve overall revenue.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that identifies customers at risk of churning. Using machine learning techniques, we analyze various customer-related factors, including demographics, account information, and internet usage, to uncover insights and improve customer retention strategies.

## Files and Structure

- **`Telecom_Customer_Churn_project.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook with the full analysis, model development, and evaluation. This notebook covers data loading, exploration, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation.
- **Data Files**: The dataset includes customer-related information, each provided as a CSV file:
  - [churn_data.csv](link_to_churn_data.csv): Core data on customer churn status.
  - [customer_data.csv](link_to_customer_data.csv): Contains customer demographics and account information.
  - [internet_data.csv](link_to_internet_data.csv): Details customers' internet service usage.
  - [Telecom Churn Data Dictionary.csv](link_to_data_dictionary.csv): A data dictionary providing definitions for each feature in the datasets.

> **Note:** Please replace `link_to_churn_data.csv`, `link_to_customer_data.csv`, `link_to_internet_data.csv`, and `link_to_data_dictionary.csv` with the actual URLs where the files are hosted.
